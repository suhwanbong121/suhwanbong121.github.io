Hi, I'm **Suhwan Bong**!

I am an incoming Biostatistics PhD student at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I completed my master’s degree in Statistics at Seoul National University (SNU), where I was mentored by Professor [Kwonsang Lee](https://www.kwonsanglee.com/). Prior to my MS, I earned a bachelor’s degree in Statistics and Mathematics, also at SNU.

My primary research interests lie in the broad field of causal inference and its applications in biomedical data. I am passionate about developing and applying statistical methods to uncover meaningful insights from complex datasets, aiming to contribute to advancements in public health.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy staying active through working out and playing tennis. I also enjoy watching baseball and soccer games in my free time.

For further details about my academic background, research experience, and publications, please refer to my comprehensive [CV](../files/SuhwanbongCV.pdf).
